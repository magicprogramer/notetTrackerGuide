    vaults here are a way to organize the notes which share common things together
    lets say u study three subjects math, programming and English and want to add notes on those subjects
    a good way is to create three vaults math, programming and English:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src = "img/4.PNG">
    <img src = "img/5.PNG">
    <br>
    then we can add notes lets say you are learning about prime numbers all you need to do is to click on
    the math vault then add a note call it primes:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src = "img/6.PNG" class = 'smaller'>
    <img src= "img/7.PNG" class = "smaller">
    <img src = "img/8.PNG" class = "smaller">
    <br>
    <br>
    now open the Note called "primes"
    click on add paragraph 
    add the info you want
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <img src = "img/9.PNG">
    <img src = "img/10.PNG">
    <img src = "img/11.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    now you have a section/pargraph inside your note you can delete, update or show more information about the 
    paragraph like the created date.
    <br>
    <br>
    <a href = "recently_visited.html" class = "btn btn-info">recently visited Notes</a>
</body>
</html>
